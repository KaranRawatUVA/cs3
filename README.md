# Presidential Inauguration Speeches Case Study
### A DS 4002 Case Study by Karan Rawat

## Hook and Rubric Documents
Hook and Rubric Documents are both located at the top level of this repo. [The Hook Document](https://github.com/KaranRawatUVA/cs3/blob/main/Hook%20Document.pdf) will orient you to this Case Study and give you an introduction to it. [The Rubric](https://github.com/KaranRawatUVA/cs3/blob/main/Rubric.pdf) will tell you exactly what I am looking for. Make sure to look at these documents first and as you complete your project.

## Various Materials
Also at the top level is the folder [Various Materials](https://github.com/KaranRawatUVA/cs3/tree/main/Various%20Materials). This folder contains articles relating to the project. These articles aim to help motivate and contextualize the project better for the student. One article focuses on how polarized the U.S. is, another on its negative effects on health, and there is an article that also explains one of the main coding aspects (sentiment analysis). This folder also contains the folders Code Example and Data Example.

## Code Example
The folder [Code Example](https://github.com/KaranRawatUVA/cs3/tree/main/Various%20Materials/Example%20Code) provides coding examples for important parts of the project. Specifically, there is one example on scraping and one example on Point Biserial Correlation and other models. Make sure to look at these examples before you try to code these parts by yourself.

## Data Example
The folder [Data Example](https://github.com/KaranRawatUVA/cs3/tree/main/Various%20Materials/Example%20Data) provides examples of how the data should look. It includes a CSV file that shows the data post-scraping and sentiment analysis. You do not have to exactly replicate how the sentiment analysis is done in this data, but make sure it follows the general idea of this dataset.
